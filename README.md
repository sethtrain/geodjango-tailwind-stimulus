# Django+Tailwind+Stimulus

A, somewhat, opinionated approach to build a modern Django project with Tailwind, Stimulus and Turbo.  I feel it is a best of both worlds approach to web development in 2024.
It provides the power of Django and templating with the dynamic modern capabilites of the frontend with Stimulus without having to sacrifice all the things to build a react application.

## Usage

    $ cookiecutter ../django-tailwind-stimulus

## Batteries Included

* Django
* Tailwind
* Stimulus
* Django Channels (Daphne)
* Django Debug Toolbar
* Django Organizations
* Django Polymorphic
* Auto-instrumented with OTEL
